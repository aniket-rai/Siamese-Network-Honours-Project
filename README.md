# University of Auckland --> Part IV Project 
## Real-Time Face Recognition System using Modular Miniaturized Computer and Deep Neural Network
This research project aims at building a stand-alone hardware system that runs deep neural network learning models for real-time face recognition applications. It will use a NVIDIA Jetson Developer Kit.

In this project, we will create a system that can instantly know whether a person captured by the developed system camera has ever been seen before. When the system captures a face, it records the time and date so it can tell when the person has been seen previously. There are two parts in this project; a hardware part and an algorithmic part.

In the hardware part, we will be using a miniaturized computer available in the market.

In the algorithmic part, a deep neural network will be developed to recognize faces. The face of a captured person image has to be tracked and extracted from the background beforehand, then the recognition process starts. Python programming language will be used within an Anaconda environment. Tensor flow framework and Keras rich neural network library will be used to ease the implementation of the algorithms. OpenCV library can be used in implementing the face recognition component of this project. The students are expected to code some algorithms from scratch as well as using any available library.
