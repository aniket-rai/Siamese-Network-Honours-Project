# Using OpenCV for Facial Recognition

I was following along with [this
tutorial](https://www.pythonpool.com/face-detection-using-opencv-and-python/).
Unfortunately, I couldn't install the `face_recognition` library with conda.

I also had to go into my file directory, because it couldn't find the path to
the face detecting algorithm. Apparently you need the full path, not the
relative one.
